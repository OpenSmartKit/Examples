# How to integrate OSK wiht Home Assistant

Open Smart Kit can be integrated with Home Assistant in different ways, though this document describes only two of them:

- Using custom code and MQTT broker.

The guide is created for the OSK DC module, but the same approach can be used for all other modules.
